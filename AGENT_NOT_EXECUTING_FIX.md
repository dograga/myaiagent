# Agent Not Executing Actions Fix

## Issue

Agent reads files, identifies changes correctly, but then says "I have modified the function" or "I have updated the file" **without actually executing the write_file action**.

### Example Behavior:

```
User: "Update the calculate function in math.py to handle division by zero"

Agent:
1. Reads math.py ✓
2. Identifies the change needed ✓
3. Says: "I have modified the calculate function to handle division by zero" ❌
4. Never calls write_file ❌
5. File remains unchanged ❌
```

## Root Cause

The LLM was "hallucinating" that it had made changes without actually using the tools. This happens because:

1. **The agent reads the file** and understands what needs to change
2. **The agent thinks about the solution** mentally
3. **The agent reports the change as done** without executing the action
4. **No tool is invoked**, so no actual file modification occurs

This is a common issue with LLM agents - they can confuse planning with execution.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Strengthened Prompt Rules**

**Added explicit rules:**
```
CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- You CANNOT modify files by just thinking about it - you MUST use write_file or append_to_file tools
- NEVER say "I have modified the file" without an Action/Observation showing the tool was used
- If you read a file and identified changes needed, you MUST then use write_file to apply them
- After reading a file, the next step is ALWAYS an Action (write_file/append_to_file), not Final Answer
- The Observation will confirm if the file was actually modified
- Only report success in Final Answer if you see "File written successfully" in an Observation
```

**Key additions:**
- ❌ "You CANNOT modify files by just thinking about it"
- ✅ "You MUST use write_file or append_to_file tools"
- ✅ "After reading a file, the next step is ALWAYS an Action"
- ✅ "Only report success if you see 'File written successfully'"

### 2. **Updated Tool Description**

**Before:**
```python
description='Useful for writing content to a file...'
```

**After:**
```python
description='REQUIRED for creating or updating files. You MUST use this tool to actually modify file contents. Just reading a file and thinking about changes does NOT modify it...'
```

Emphasizes:
- **REQUIRED** for modifications
- **MUST use** this tool
- **Reading ≠ Modifying**

### 3. **Updated Thought Template**

**Before:**
```
Thought: I will now execute this action
```

**After:**
```
Thought: I need to use [tool_name] to make this change
```

Forces the agent to explicitly name the tool it will use.

### 4. **Increased Max Iterations**

```python
AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    max_iterations=10,  # Allow multiple steps
    early_stopping_method="generate",  # Don't stop early
    handle_parsing_errors=True  # Handle errors gracefully
)
```

Ensures the agent has enough iterations to:
1. Read the file
2. Process the content
3. Write the modified file
4. Report the result

## How It Works Now

### Correct Workflow:

```
User: "Update the calculate function in math.py to handle division by zero"

Agent Step 1:
Thought: I need to read the file first
Action: read_file
Action Input: math.py
Observation: [file contents]

Agent Step 2:
Thought: I need to use write_file to modify the function
Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "math.py", "content": "def calculate(a, b, op):\n    if op == '/' and b == 0:\n        return 'Error: Division by zero'\n    ..."}
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "File written successfully to math.py"}

Agent Step 3:
Thought: I have completed the requested actions
Final Answer: I have successfully modified the calculate function in math.py to handle division by zero. The function now checks if the operation is division and the divisor is zero, returning an error message in that case.
```

### Key Differences:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Read → Think → Report | Read → **Write** → Report |
| No Action after Read | **Action (write_file)** after Read |
| No Observation of success | **Observation: "File written successfully"** |
| Claims success without proof | Reports success **based on Observation** |

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Update

**Request:**
```
Update hello.py to print "Hello, World!" instead of "Hello"
```

**Expected Flow:**
```
Action: read_file
Action Input: hello.py
Observation: def hello():\n    print('Hello')

Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "hello.py", "content": "def hello():\\n    print('Hello, World!')\\n"}
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "File written successfully to hello.py"}

Final Answer: I have updated hello.py to print "Hello, World!" instead of "Hello".
```

**Verify:**
```bash
cat hello.py
# Should show: print('Hello, World!')
```

### Test Case 2: Add Function

**Request:**
```
Add a goodbye function to hello.py
```

**Expected Flow:**
```
Action: read_file
Action Input: hello.py
Observation: [current content]

Action: append_to_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "hello.py", "content": "\\ndef goodbye():\\n    print('Goodbye!')\\n"}
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "Content appended successfully to hello.py"}

Final Answer: I have added a goodbye function to hello.py.
```

### Test Case 3: Complex Update

**Request:**
```
Update calculator.py to add error handling for division by zero
```

**Expected Flow:**
```
Action: read_file
Action Input: calculator.py
Observation: [current content]

Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "calculator.py", "content": "[full updated content with error handling]"}
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "File written successfully to calculator.py"}

Final Answer: I have updated calculator.py to include error handling for division by zero...
```

## How to Apply

### 1. Restart the Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Create New Session

The agent needs a fresh session to use the new prompt:

**In UI:**
- Click "New Session"

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/session/create
```

### 3. Test with a File Update

```bash
# Create a test file first
echo "def hello():\n    print('Hello')" > test.py

# Ask agent to update it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Update test.py to print Hello World instead of Hello",
    "session_id": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "show_details": true
  }'
```

### 4. Verify the Change

```bash
cat test.py
# Should show: print('Hello World')
```

### 5. Check Thought Process

In the response, look for:
```json
{
  "thought_process": [
    {
      "action": "read_file",
      "observation": "..."
    },
    {
      "action": "write_file",  // ← Should see this!
      "observation": "File written successfully"  // ← And this!
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification Checklist

After the fix, the agent should:

- ✅ Read the file first (if needed)
- ✅ Use write_file or append_to_file action
- ✅ Show "File written successfully" in Observation
- ✅ Report what it DID (not what it WILL do)
- ✅ Actually modify the file on disk

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Still Not Executing?

1. **Check AUTO_APPROVE is enabled:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq '.config.auto_approve'
   # Should return: true
   ```

2. **Verify server restarted:**
   ```bash
   # Look for "Application startup complete" in logs
   ```

3. **Create new session:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/session/create
   ```

4. **Check thought process:**
   Set `show_details: true` in the request to see what the agent is doing

5. **Look for Action in response:**
   ```json
   {
     "thought_process": [
       {
         "action": "write_file",  // ← Must see this
         "action_input": "...",
         "observation": "File written successfully"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Agent Stops After Reading?

**Symptoms:**
- Agent reads file
- Agent says "I will update..."
- No write_file action follows

**Solution:**
The new prompt explicitly states:
```
After reading a file, the next step is ALWAYS an Action (write_file/append_to_file), not Final Answer
```

If this still happens:
1. Check `max_iterations` is set to 10
2. Verify `early_stopping_method="generate"`
3. Create a new session

### How to Confirm Fix is Working

**In the UI:**
1. Enable "Show Thought Process"
2. Ask agent to update a file
3. Expand thought process
4. You should see:
   - Step 1: read_file
   - Step 2: write_file (or append_to_file)
   - Observation: "File written successfully"

**Via Logs:**
```bash
# In the terminal running uvicorn, look for:
Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "...", "content": "..."}
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "File written successfully"}
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Read → Write
```
User: "Change X in file.py"
Agent: read_file → write_file → Report success ✓
```

### Pattern 2: Direct Write (New File)
```
User: "Create a new file.py with X"
Agent: write_file → Report success ✓
```

### Pattern 3: Read → Append
```
User: "Add function X to file.py"
Agent: read_file → append_to_file → Report success ✓
```

### Pattern 4: Read → Multiple Writes
```
User: "Update file1.py and file2.py"
Agent: read_file(file1) → write_file(file1) → read_file(file2) → write_file(file2) → Report success ✓
```

## Files Changed

1. **agent/developer_agent.py**
   - Lines 245-271: Strengthened CRITICAL RULES in AUTO-APPROVE prompt
   - Line 220: Updated write_file tool description
   - Lines 386-388: Added max_iterations and early_stopping_method

## Summary

✅ **Strengthened prompt rules** - Explicit "you MUST use tools"  
✅ **Updated tool description** - Emphasizes REQUIRED for modifications  
✅ **Changed thought template** - Forces explicit tool naming  
✅ **Increased max_iterations** - Allows multi-step workflows  
✅ **Added verification rules** - Only report success with Observation proof  

**Result:** Agent now actually executes write_file/append_to_file actions instead of just claiming it did!
