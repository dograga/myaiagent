# Developer Agent Prompt Improvements

## Problem Statement
The Developer Agent was sometimes failing to:
1. Understand requirements clearly
2. Take concrete actions (just describing action plans instead)
3. Read relevant files before making changes
4. Execute the full workflow from analysis to completion

## Solution: Enhanced Action-Oriented Prompt

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Primary Directive - Action Over Planning**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL - YOUR PRIMARY DIRECTIVE ⚠️

**YOU MUST TAKE ACTION - NOT JUST DESCRIBE ACTIONS**
- Your job is to EXECUTE tasks, not just explain what should be done
- NEVER respond with only an action plan without executing it
- ALWAYS use tools to read files, modify code, and complete the task
- Only provide a Final Answer AFTER you have taken concrete actions
```

**Why:** Makes it crystal clear that the agent must execute, not just plan.

#### 2. **Mandatory 4-Step Workflow**

**STEP 1: ANALYZE & GATHER INFORMATION**
- Use `list_directory` to understand project structure
- Use `read_file` to read ALL relevant files
- Read related files for context (imports, dependencies)
- Understand existing code before changes

**STEP 2: CREATE ACTION PLAN**
- Create specific plan with tool names
- Be concrete about what will be done

**STEP 3: EXECUTE THE PLAN**
- Take each action one by one
- Verify results after each action
- Adjust if needed

**STEP 4: PROVIDE FINAL ANSWER**
- Summarize what was ACTUALLY DONE
- Include specific files modified

**Why:** Provides a clear structure that forces the agent to follow a complete workflow.

#### 3. **Enhanced Critical Rules**

Added 8 explicit rules with warning symbols:
1. ⚠️ **NEVER** respond with just "I understand" or only an action plan
2. ⚠️ **ALWAYS** use `read_file` to read relevant files BEFORE making changes
3. ⚠️ **ALWAYS** use `list_directory` if needed to understand project structure
4. ⚠️ **ALWAYS** use tools to complete the task - don't just describe
5. **NEVER** use `write_file` to modify existing files
6. **ALWAYS** use `read_file` first before `modify_code_block`
7. The `search_block` must match existing code EXACTLY
8. **ALWAYS** provide comprehensive Final Answer AFTER taking actions

**Why:** Multiple reinforcements with visual emphasis ensure the agent follows the rules.

#### 4. **Concrete Example Workflow**

Added a complete example showing:
- Using `list_directory` to explore
- Using `read_file` to analyze
- Creating an action plan
- Executing each step with tools
- Providing a final answer with checkmarks

**Why:** Shows the agent exactly what a successful execution looks like.

#### 5. **Executor Mindset Reinforcement**

Added final reminder:
```
**REMEMBER:** You are an EXECUTOR, not a PLANNER. Take action, don't just describe actions!
```

**Why:** Final reinforcement of the primary directive.

#### 6. **Improved Final Answer Format**

Changed from generic "Action Plan Executed" to:
- **Actions Taken:** (with checkmarks ✅)
- **Files Modified:** (specific list with changes)
- **Results:** (detailed impact)

**Why:** Forces the agent to report on actual actions taken, not planned actions.

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before (Problem Behavior)
```
Thought: I'll create an action plan:
1. Read the file
2. Modify the function
3. Add tests

Final Answer:
To complete this task, you should:
1. Read main.py to understand the code
2. Modify the function to add the new feature
3. Add unit tests for the changes
```
❌ **No actions taken, just described what should be done**

### After (Expected Behavior)
```
Action: list_directory
Action Input: .
Observation: [files listed]

Action: read_file
Action Input: main.py
Observation: [file content]

Thought: Based on my analysis, here's my action plan:
1. Modify function in main.py using modify_code_block
2. Add tests using write_file

Action: modify_code_block
Action Input: {"file_path": "main.py", ...}
Observation: File modified successfully

Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "test_main.py", ...}
Observation: File created successfully

Final Answer:
**Summary:**
I successfully added the new feature and tests.

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Read main.py to analyze current implementation
2. ✅ Modified add_numbers() function to handle edge cases
3. ✅ Created test_main.py with unit tests

**Files Modified:**
- main.py: Modified add_numbers() function
- test_main.py: Created new file with 5 test cases
```
✅ **Concrete actions taken with tools, files actually modified**

## Impact

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Higher action completion rate** - Agent will execute tasks instead of just planning
2. **Better context understanding** - Agent will read files before making changes
3. **Fewer errors** - Reading files first ensures accurate modifications
4. **More reliable execution** - Mandatory workflow ensures consistent behavior
5. **Clearer results** - Final answer shows what was actually done

### Metrics to Track:
- % of queries where agent takes at least one action
- % of queries where agent reads files before modifying
- % of successful file modifications (no errors)
- User satisfaction with completed tasks

## Testing Recommendations

Test the improved agent with scenarios that previously failed:

1. **Vague requirements:**
   - "Fix the bug in the login function"
   - Expected: Agent reads relevant files, identifies issue, fixes it

2. **Multi-file changes:**
   - "Add a new API endpoint with tests"
   - Expected: Agent reads existing code, creates endpoint, adds tests

3. **Refactoring tasks:**
   - "Refactor the database module to use async"
   - Expected: Agent reads module, understands structure, makes changes

4. **Complex modifications:**
   - "Update the authentication to use JWT tokens"
   - Expected: Agent reads auth code, plans changes, executes modifications

## Rollback Plan

If the new prompt causes issues:
1. The old prompt is preserved in git history
2. Simply revert the changes to `developer_agent.py`
3. Restart the service

## Notes

- The prompt is significantly longer but more explicit
- Uses visual markers (⚠️, ✅) for emphasis
- Provides concrete examples of correct behavior
- Reinforces key concepts multiple times
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing tools and API
