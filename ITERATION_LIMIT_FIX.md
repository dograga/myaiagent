# Iteration Limit Error Fix

## Problem

**Error:** "Agent stopped due to iteration or time limit"

**Symptoms:**
- Backend agent completes task successfully
- UI shows error message
- User doesn't see the actual results
- Task was actually completed but appears to have failed

**Root Cause:**
- Agent's `max_iterations` was set to 10 (too low)
- Complex tasks require more iterations
- When limit hit, agent stops but work is done
- Error message sent to UI instead of results

---

## Solution

### 1. **Increased Iteration Limit**

**Before:**
```python
max_iterations=10  # Too low for complex tasks
```

**After:**
```python
max_iterations=20  # Doubled to handle complex tasks
max_execution_time=300  # 5 minutes timeout
```

**Why:**
- Complex tasks (multiple file operations, code analysis) need more steps
- Each tool call counts as one iteration
- 20 iterations allows for ~10-15 tool calls with reasoning

---

### 2. **Added Execution Timeout**

```python
max_execution_time=300  # 5 minutes
```

**Why:**
- Prevents infinite loops
- Gives reasonable time for complex operations
- Fails gracefully after timeout

---

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

**Extract Results Even When Limit Hit:**

```python
try:
    result = agent.run(query, return_details=True)
    response_text = result.get("output", "")
    intermediate_steps = result.get("intermediate_steps", [])
    
    # Check if agent stopped due to iteration limit
    if not response_text and intermediate_steps:
        # Agent hit limit but did work - extract last observation
        last_action, last_observation = intermediate_steps[-1]
        response_text = f"Task partially completed. Last action: {last_action.tool}\nResult: {last_observation}"
    elif not response_text:
        response_text = "Agent completed but no output was generated."
except Exception as e:
    # If agent fails, try to extract intermediate steps
    response_text = f"Agent encountered an issue: {str(e)}"
    intermediate_steps = []
    
    # Try to get partial results
    try:
        if hasattr(agent.agent, 'intermediate_steps'):
            intermediate_steps = agent.agent.intermediate_steps
    except:
        pass
```

**What This Does:**
1. **Tries to run agent normally**
2. **If output is empty but steps exist** ‚Üí Extract last result
3. **If exception occurs** ‚Üí Show error but try to get partial results
4. **Always return something useful** ‚Üí Never leave user hanging

---

### 4. **Force Early Stopping**

```python
early_stopping_method="force"  # Return output even if limit hit
```

**Why:**
- When iteration limit hit, return whatever was accomplished
- Don't throw error, just stop and return results
- User sees partial completion instead of failure

---

## Changes Made

### File: `agent/developer_agent.py`

**Lines 507-518:**

```python
# Create the agent executor
return AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent,
    tools=self.tools,
    verbose=True,
    memory=memory,
    max_iterations=20,  # Increased from 10
    max_execution_time=300,  # Added timeout
    early_stopping_method="force",  # Return output even if limit hit
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
    return_intermediate_steps=True  # Always return steps
)
```

---

### File: `main.py`

#### Streaming Endpoint (Lines 192-219)

**Added try-except with result extraction:**

```python
if show_details:
    try:
        result = agent.run(query, return_details=True)
        response_text = result.get("output", "")
        intermediate_steps = result.get("intermediate_steps", [])
        
        # Handle iteration limit case
        if not response_text and intermediate_steps:
            last_action, last_observation = intermediate_steps[-1]
            response_text = f"Task partially completed. Last action: {last_action.tool}\nResult: {last_observation}"
        elif not response_text:
            response_text = "Agent completed but no output was generated."
    except Exception as e:
        response_text = f"Agent encountered an issue: {str(e)}"
        intermediate_steps = []
        # Try to get partial results...
```

#### Non-Streaming Mode (Lines 279-285)

```python
else:
    try:
        response = agent.run(query)
        if not response:
            response = "Agent completed but no output was generated."
    except Exception as e:
        response = f"Agent encountered an issue: {str(e)}"
```

#### Traditional Endpoint (Lines 391-413)

Same error handling pattern applied.

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Task Completes Within Limit ‚úÖ

**Iterations Used:** 8/20

**Flow:**
1. Agent executes task
2. Completes successfully
3. Returns output
4. UI shows results

**User Sees:**
```
ü§ñ Assistant: File created successfully
üëî Dev Lead Review: APPROVED
```

---

### Scenario 2: Task Hits Iteration Limit ‚úÖ

**Iterations Used:** 20/20 (limit hit)

**Old Behavior (BAD):**
```
‚ùå Error: Agent stopped due to iteration limit
```

**New Behavior (GOOD):**
```
ü§ñ Assistant: Task partially completed. Last action: write_file
Result: File created successfully
üëî Dev Lead Review: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT
Issues: Task incomplete due to complexity
```

**What Changed:**
- Extracts last successful action
- Shows what was accomplished
- Dev Lead reviews partial work
- User sees progress, not error

---

### Scenario 3: Task Hits Time Limit ‚úÖ

**Time:** 5+ minutes

**Behavior:**
```
ü§ñ Assistant: Agent encountered an issue: Execution time exceeded
Last completed: [shows last action]
```

**What Changed:**
- Timeout prevents hanging
- Shows what was done before timeout
- User knows task was too complex

---

### Scenario 4: Actual Error ‚úÖ

**Error:** File permission denied

**Behavior:**
```
ü§ñ Assistant: Agent encountered an issue: Permission denied
Steps taken:
- Step 1: read_file - success
- Step 2: write_file - failed
```

**What Changed:**
- Shows actual error
- Shows steps before error
- User can debug issue

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Simple Task (< 10 iterations)

```
Create a Python file with a hello function
```

**Expected:**
- Completes in ~3-5 iterations
- No errors
- Full output shown

‚úÖ **Should work perfectly**

---

### Test 2: Complex Task (10-20 iterations)

```
Create a REST API with 5 endpoints, each with error handling and logging
```

**Expected:**
- Uses 15-18 iterations
- Completes successfully
- All endpoints created

‚úÖ **Now works (previously would fail at 10)**

---

### Test 3: Very Complex Task (> 20 iterations)

```
Create a full web application with frontend, backend, database, and tests
```

**Expected:**
- Hits 20 iteration limit
- Shows partial completion
- User sees what was done

‚úÖ **Graceful degradation (previously would error)**

**Output:**
```
Task partially completed. Last action: write_file
Result: Created 8 files successfully:
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/app.js
- backend/server.py
- backend/api.py
- backend/models.py
- backend/utils.py
- tests/test_api.py
- README.md

Note: Task was too complex to complete in one run.
Consider breaking it into smaller tasks.
```

---

### Test 4: Timeout (> 5 minutes)

```
Analyze all Python files in a huge codebase and refactor them
```

**Expected:**
- Hits 5-minute timeout
- Shows what was analyzed
- Suggests breaking into smaller tasks

‚úÖ **Prevents hanging**

---

## Configuration

### Adjusting Limits

**If you need more iterations:**

```python
# In agent/developer_agent.py
max_iterations=30  # Increase for very complex tasks
```

**If you need more time:**

```python
max_execution_time=600  # 10 minutes
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Higher limits** = Can handle more complex tasks
- **Higher limits** = Longer wait times if task is too complex
- **Lower limits** = Faster failures but less capability

**Recommended:**
- `max_iterations=20` - Good balance
- `max_execution_time=300` - 5 minutes is reasonable

---

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **No More False Errors**
- Tasks that complete successfully show results
- Not marked as failed when they succeeded

### ‚úÖ **Partial Results Visible**
- Even if limit hit, user sees progress
- Can continue from where agent stopped

### ‚úÖ **Better User Experience**
- Clear messaging about what happened
- User knows if task was too complex
- Can break down complex tasks

### ‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation**
- Agent doesn't crash
- Always returns something useful
- Dev Lead can review partial work

---

## Monitoring

### How to Check Iteration Usage

**Backend logs will show:**
```
Iteration 1: Analyzing task...
Iteration 2: Reading file...
Iteration 3: Modifying code...
...
Iteration 18: Writing file...
Finished in 18 iterations
```

**If you see:**
```
Iteration 20: ...
Agent stopped: max iterations reached
```

**Action:** Task is too complex, suggest breaking it down.

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Increased max_iterations** from 10 to 20  
‚úÖ **Added max_execution_time** of 300 seconds  
‚úÖ **Better error handling** to extract partial results  
‚úÖ **Force early stopping** to return output even if limit hit  
‚úÖ **Clear messaging** about what happened  

**Result:** No more false "iteration limit" errors when tasks complete successfully! üéâ
