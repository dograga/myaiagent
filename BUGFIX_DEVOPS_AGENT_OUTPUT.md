# Bug Fix: DevOps Agent Output Format Error

## Issue
DevOps agent was throwing errors like:
```
Agent encountered an issue 
 ami="ami-123"
 instance_type="t2"
```

The agent was outputting raw Terraform/Kubernetes/Jenkins code directly instead of following the proper "Thought/Action/Action Input" format required by the LangChain agent framework.

## Root Cause
The DevOps agent's prompt template had an example that showed raw code in the "Observation" section, which may have confused the LLM into thinking it should output raw code directly. The prompt didn't have strong enough warnings against outputting raw code.

## Solution
Updated the DevOps agent prompt template in `agent/devops_agent.py` to:

### 1. Simplified the Example (Lines 402-408)
**Before**: Had a complex modify_code_block example with raw Terraform code in the Observation
**After**: Simplified to a clear write_file example showing the complete workflow

```python
**Example Workflow:**
Thought: I need to understand the user's requirement for creating a Terraform EC2 configuration.
Action: write_file
Action Input: {{"file_path": "terraform/main.tf", "content": "resource \\"aws_instance\\" \\"web\\" {{\\n  ami = \\"ami-123\\"\\n  instance_type = \\"t2.micro\\"\\n}}"}}
Observation: File written successfully
Thought: I have created the Terraform configuration file. Now I should explain what was done.
Final Answer: I have created a Terraform configuration file at terraform/main.tf that defines an AWS EC2 instance resource. The configuration includes the AMI ID and instance type. You can now run 'terraform init' and 'terraform apply' to provision this resource.
```

### 2. Added Strong Warnings (Lines 413-437)
Added explicit warnings and examples of what NOT to do:

```
⚠️ NEVER OUTPUT RAW CODE DIRECTLY ⚠️
DO NOT output Terraform/Kubernetes/Jenkins code directly in your response.
ALWAYS wrap code in the proper Action/Action Input format using the tools.

WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS:
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami = "ami-123"
}

RIGHT - DO THIS:
Thought: I need to create a Terraform file
Action: write_file
Action Input: {"file_path": "main.tf", "content": "resource \"aws_instance\" \"web\" {\n  ami = \"ami-123\"\n}"}
```

### 3. Strengthened Critical Rules (Lines 439-444)
Added emphasis on always starting with "Thought:":

```
CRITICAL RULES:
- **Always** start with "Thought:" - never output raw code directly
- **Always** use `read_file` first to get the exact content before using `modify_code_block`
- **NEVER** use `write_file` to modify an existing file. Use `modify_code_block` or `append_to_file`
- **ALWAYS** explain your understanding of the requirement
- **NEVER** give a final answer as just "I understand" - explain the solution in detail
```

## Files Modified
- `agent/devops_agent.py` - Lines 402-444 (prompt template improvements)

## Testing
After this fix, test the DevOps agent with various prompts:

### Test Case 1: Create Terraform File
**Prompt**: "Create a Terraform configuration for an AWS S3 bucket"
**Expected**: Agent should use write_file tool with proper JSON format, not output raw HCL code

### Test Case 2: Create Kubernetes Deployment
**Prompt**: "Create a Kubernetes deployment for nginx"
**Expected**: Agent should use write_file tool with proper YAML content in JSON format

### Test Case 3: Create Jenkins Pipeline
**Prompt**: "Create a Jenkinsfile for a Node.js application"
**Expected**: Agent should use write_file tool with proper Groovy pipeline code

### Test Case 4: Modify Existing File
**Prompt**: "Change the instance type in main.tf to t2.large"
**Expected**: Agent should:
1. Use read_file to get current content
2. Use modify_code_block to make the change
3. Explain what was changed

## Why This Works
1. **Clear Examples**: The simplified example shows the exact format expected
2. **Explicit Warnings**: Multiple warnings about NOT outputting raw code
3. **Visual Contrast**: Shows WRONG vs RIGHT side-by-side
4. **Reinforced Rules**: Critical rules emphasize starting with "Thought:"

The LLM now has clear guidance that it must ALWAYS use the tool format and NEVER output raw code directly.

## Comparison with Developer Agent
The Developer Agent didn't have this issue because:
- It typically works with smaller code snippets
- The examples in its prompt were clearer
- It had fewer complex multi-line code examples

The DevOps Agent needed stronger guidance because:
- Terraform/Kubernetes/Jenkins configs are often multi-line
- The LLM might be tempted to show the "full" code directly
- Infrastructure code examples are more complex

## Additional Notes
- The DevOps Lead Agent was working fine because it doesn't use the same execution format - it just reviews and provides feedback
- This fix maintains all the original functionality while fixing the output format issue
- No changes were needed to the output parser or agent executor - the issue was purely in the prompt guidance
