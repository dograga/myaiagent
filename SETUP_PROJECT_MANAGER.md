# Quick Setup Guide: Project Manager Agent

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Active Jira account
- Existing backend and UI setup

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Generate Jira API Token
1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click **"Create API token"**
3. Name it (e.g., "AI Agent")
4. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Jira Configuration
JIRA_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=paste-your-token-here
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `your-company` with your actual Jira domain
- Use your Jira login email for `JIRA_USERNAME`
- Paste the API token you just generated

## Step 4: Restart Backend
```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
python main.py
```

## Step 5: Test the Agent

### In the UI:
1. Select **"üìä Project Manager Agent"** from the dropdown
2. Try these queries:

**Test 1: List Your Epics**
```
List all epics assigned to me
```

**Test 2: View Epic Stories**
```
Show me stories in epic PROJ-123
```
(Replace PROJ-123 with an actual epic key from your Jira)

**Test 3: Update Story**
```
Update story PROJ-456 status to In Progress
```
(Replace PROJ-456 with an actual story key)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "JIRA_URL must be provided"
- Check your `.env` file has `JIRA_URL` set
- Restart the backend after adding it

### Error: "HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized"
- Verify `JIRA_USERNAME` is your Jira email
- Regenerate API token and update `.env`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the values

### Error: "HTTP Error 403: Forbidden"
- You don't have permission to access that epic/story
- Try with an epic/story you're assigned to

### Error: "HTTP Error 404: Not Found"
- The epic/story key doesn't exist
- Check the key format (e.g., PROJ-123)
- Verify you have access to that project

## Example Queries

### View Your Work
```
What epics are assigned to me?
List my assigned epics
Show me my epics
```

### Epic Details
```
Show details of epic PROJ-123
What's the status of epic PROJ-123?
How many stories are in epic PROJ-123?
```

### Story Information
```
Show stories in epic PROJ-123
What's the status of story PROJ-456?
List all stories in PROJ-123 and their statuses
```

### Update Stories
```
Update story PROJ-456 status to Done
Change PROJ-456 status to In Progress
Mark story PROJ-456 as Done
Assign story PROJ-456 to john.doe
Add comment to PROJ-456: "Completed implementation"
```

### Search
```
Find all high priority stories assigned to me
Search for stories in progress in project PROJ
Show all bugs in project PROJ
```

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It contains your API token
2. **Rotate tokens regularly** - Generate new tokens periodically
3. **Use read-only tokens if possible** - Limit permissions to what's needed
4. **Don't share tokens** - Each user should have their own token
