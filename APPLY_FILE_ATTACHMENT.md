# File Attachment - Ready to Apply

## Status

‚úÖ **Backend (main.py)** - ALREADY COMPLETE
- `attached_files` field added to QueryRequest
- `format_query_with_files()` helper function exists
- Both streaming and non-streaming endpoints updated
- Files are formatted and passed to agents

‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend (ui/src/App.tsx)** - NEEDS MANUAL APPLICATION

## How to Apply Frontend Changes

I've created a detailed patch file: `file_attachment.patch`

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open** `ui/src/App.tsx` in your editor

2. **Follow the patch file** `file_attachment.patch` which has 6 parts:
   - Part 1: Add state variables (2 lines)
   - Part 2: Add helper functions (4 functions)
   - Part 3: Update sendMessage function (complete replacement)
   - Part 4: Update sendMessageStreaming signature (1 line change)
   - Part 5: Update sendMessageStreaming body (add 1 line)
   - Part 6: Update form HTML (complete replacement with inline styles)

3. **Save the file**

4. **Restart the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd ui
   npm run dev
   ```

## What You'll Get

After applying the patch:

1. **üìé Attach Button** - Click to select files
2. **File Chips** - See attached files with remove buttons
3. **Original Textarea** - Full size, no CSS conflicts
4. **Backend Integration** - Files sent with query automatically

## Design Choices

- **Inline styles** used in Part 6 to avoid CSS conflicts
- **Simple, clean UI** that matches existing design
- **Multiple file support** - Attach several files at once
- **Error handling** - Gracefully handles file read errors

## Testing

After applying:

1. Click the üìé button
2. Select a file (e.g., a .py or .txt file)
3. See the file appear as a chip above the input
4. Type your message
5. Click Send
6. The agent will receive both your message and file contents

## Example Usage

**User types:** "Review this code for bugs"
**User attaches:** `app.py`
**Agent receives:**
```
Review this code for bugs

**Attached Files:**

--- File: app.py ---
[full file content here]
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running (`python main.py`)
3. Check that file is being read (console.log in readFileContent)

The patch uses inline styles to avoid any CSS conflicts, so your textarea will remain full size!
